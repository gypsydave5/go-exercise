Look at `main.go` and write the `trecimate()` function that works as outlined below.

First, you mash in a random large number to start with. Then, repeatedly do the following:

If the number is divisible by 3, divide it by 3.

If it's not, either add 1 or subtract 1 (to make it divisible by 3), then divide it by 3.

The game stops when you reach "1".
